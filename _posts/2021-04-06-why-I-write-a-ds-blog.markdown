I am very excited to launch my own data science blog. Like every other thing 
in my life, I need to figure out why I am doing this and what motivates me? 
They are no trivial questions and they are probably most important questions I ask myself in any undertaking. It predicts how well I accomplish it. Well, I can forget about performance pressure for now. Let me just have fun with it.

* Why Data Science?
1. I am a student in data science literally and will always be one figuratively. It comes as no surprise to anyone that one should understand thoroughly what one studies. 
2. Data Science as a displine is broad and deep. It is both fascinating and mind-blogging to me what it has in store for us. 
I would like to liken it to the modern alchemy. 
Businessese are allured to try it out and hope to discover data-turned silver and gold. 
I think we need a more down-to-earth approach to examine what it can and cannot do. I do not write to sell you anything like data analytics solutions but serve as a dispassionate reviewer and reason with you when it is powerful and practical and when it is not.       

* Why blogging?
1. Explaining is the most effective way to learn something in my own experience. Explaining in writing is even better. I can carefully choose my response and deliberate over what is the best way to break down a compplex concept and deliver an accessible rendition of it. 
2. I have a passion for writing. I have been itching for writing for a long time. I write to know myself, to organize my thoughts, to gain clarity into matters I care about. As of recent, I feel a strong need to answer my own questions related to data science. Many interrupted and hung-up instances at the back of my mind I have a penchant for sorting them out. Otherwise, they drive me nuts. For self-love, for cleansing, for optimized processes, I am down writing them out. Do worry. I will not ventilate my anger or frustration with bugs in this blog. I write in a calm and senible way. It is a self-discipline or self-improvement. 
3. Data Science is fast evolving. I need to form a habit to keep track of its developments and renew my own knowledge.
4. The social effect is not to ignore. I could have kept a private journal about my tech skill developments. What do I expect from people who read my blogs? I savor your comments and thoughts on what I write about. Tell me how I can improve it and how you would interprete or do it differently. 

* Why now?
1. "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now." -- a popular Chinese proverb. As a Chinese native speaker, I have not heard of it until my German friends keep saying it to my face. Despite its murky origin, it conveys the message for me neatly. 

* What format?
1. I will write in series by topic. Some topics, due to its nature, are better approached this way, for example, big data ecosystem from Hadoop, Hive, HBase to Spark.
2. I love examples. My personal learning benefits a lot from illuminating examples. I would also do so to treat my readers.

* What technology I use to write this blog?
This is not related to my motivation. However, it is a good habit to keep: always log down why you choose a technology for a job for auditting.
1. I use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to write my blogs. Jekyll is for creating static websites. You don't need the backend, i.e., the database. Since I use it for blogging, all my blogs are in written in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) language. Have you written any Readme.md? It's the same thing. It is flexible for me to write a code blog. If I would have to write blog entries in HTML, I wouldn't use it. It is part of Ruby ecosystem.
2. I plan to serve my blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. Jekyll comes as the default tool for the job. 
3. The learning curve is shallow at least for me. Publishing blogs is just like pushing code to GitHub. If you have any web development experience like Django, Jekyll feels like a hand-held calculator once you know how to use a personal computer.
4. All my blog entries are portable if one day I decide to self-host this site.
