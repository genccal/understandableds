Welcome to my blog, Understandable Data Science! 

I am very excited to launch my own data science blog. Like every other thing 
in my life, I need to ask why I am doing this and what motivates me? 
They are no trivial questions and they are probably the most important questions I ask myself before undertaking anything. It predicts how well I accomplish it. Well, I can forget about performance pressure for now. Why not just have fun with it.

&nbsp;
* Why Data Science?
1. I am a student in data science literally and will always be one figuratively. It comes as no surprise to anyone that one should understand thoroughly what one studies. 
2. Data Science as a discipline is both broad and deep. It is both fascinating and mind-blogging to me what it has in store for us, businesses and societies alike. 
I would like to liken it to modern alchemy. 
Businesses are allured to try it out and hope to discover data-turned silver and gold. 
I think we need a more down-to-earth approach to examine what it can and cannot do. I do not write to sell you any data analytics solutions but serve as a dispassionate reviewer and reason with you when it is powerful and practical and when it is not.       

&nbsp;
* Why blogging?
1. Explaining is the most effective way to learn in my own experience. Explaining in writing is even better. I can carefully choose my response and deliberate over what is the best way to break down a complex concept and deliver an accessible rendition of it. 
2. I have a passion for writing. I have been itching for writing for a long time. I write to know myself, to organize my thoughts, to gain clarity into matters I care about. As of recent, I feel a strong need to answer my own questions related to data science. Many interrupted and hung-up instances at the back of my mind occupy me and I have a penchant for sorting them out. For self-love, for cleansing, for optimized processes, I am down to write them out. Do not worry. I will not ventilate my anger or frustration with bugs in this blog. I write in a calm and sensible way. It is self-discipline or self-improvement or (both). 
3. Data Science is evolving fast. I need to form a habit to keep track of its developments and renew my own knowledge.
4. The social effect is not to ignore. I could have kept a private journal about my tech skill developments. What do I expect from people who read my blogs? I savor your comments and thoughts on my content. Tell me how I can improve it and how you would interprete or do it differently. 

&nbsp;
* Why now?
1. "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now." -- a popular Chinese proverb. As a Chinese native speaker, I have not heard of it until my German friends keep rubbing it in my face. Despite its murky origin, it conveys the message for me neatly. 

&nbsp;
* What format?
1. I will write in series by topic. Some topics, due to their nature, are better approached this way, for example, the big data ecosystem.
2. I love examples. My personal learning benefits a lot from illuminating examples. I would also do so to treat my readers.

&nbsp;
* Planned topics
1. the big data ecosystem including Hadoop, Hive, HDFS, HBase, Spark, etc.
2. quantitative finance/algorithmic trading
3. data-intensive applications

&nbsp;
* How often do I publish? 
1. I value quality over quantity. Therefore, do not expect frequent updates.
2. For the time being, I aim to publish weekly. 

&nbsp;
* What technology do I use to write this blog?

This is not related to my motivation. However, it is a good habit to keep: always log down why you choose a technology for a job for auditing.
1. I use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to write my blogs. Jekyll is for creating static websites. You don't need the backend, i.e., the database. Since I use it for blogging, all my entries are written in the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) language. Have you written any Readme.md? It's the same thing. It is flexible for me to write a code blog. If I would have to write in HTML, I wouldn't use it. It is part of Ruby ecosystem.
2. I plan to serve my blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free. Jekyll comes as the default tool for the job. 
3. The learning curve is shallow. Publishing/managing content is just like pushing code to GitHub. If you have any web development experience like Django, Jekyll feels like a hand-held calculator once you know how to use a personal computer.
4. All my blog entries are portable if one day I decide to self-host this site.
5. One drawback I have found so far: no spell check. 


**About me**

My name is Jian. It is a Chinese name, which means healthy. The character is ÂÅ•.
Besides my passion for data science, I love reading, writing, cycling and learning languages. 
To disambiguate it, I love to learn _natural_ languages. Currently I am obsessed with French.
For programming languages, I am fluent in Python and Java and a beginner in Scala.
